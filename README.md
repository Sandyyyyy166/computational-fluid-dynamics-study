# computational-fluid-dynamics-study

### 10.4 Update
A strong curiosity about Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) inspires me to start this journey. After self-studying C++ fundamentals for a while, I am undertaking this project to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical challenge, aiming to gain a deep understanding of the underlying data structures, numerical algorithms, and modern C++ software engineering practices involved in CFD solvers.
This repository will serve as my learning log, systematically showcasing the whole discovery process.
